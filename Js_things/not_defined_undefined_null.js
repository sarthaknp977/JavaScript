// not defined is an error as the thing that we try to use does not exist



// undefined is a value given to something that does not hold any value but is defined somewhere in the program


// null is a value given to something that holds nothing  its something like the thing exists but is not found

//     in this code:

var a;
var b;

console.log(a)  // undefined as there is a value called a but it is not defined
console.log(b)  //
console.log(c)  //not defined as there is not any variable called c
